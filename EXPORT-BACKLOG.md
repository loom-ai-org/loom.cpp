# Export/Compiler Backlog

Everything previously tracked here as resolved (numerical correctness, driver IR/codegen, dynamic shapes,
tokenization, export-time quantization — items 1/2/3/4/6, all verified against the real LFM2-350M
checkpoint) has been removed from this file. That history lives in git log/commit messages, not here. Only
genuinely open work remains below.

## MIL primitive review — broader ask still open

The concrete, bounded bugs originally tracked under this item (`LESS_EQUAL`/`GREATER_EQUAL` boundary bug,
dead lowercase `MilDialectRegistrar` aliases, missing `OP_MAP` entries) are fixed. Not done, deliberately
deferred:

**Audit `primitives_basic.cpp`'s ADD/MUL/MUL_MAT/REPEAT "dynamically heal transposed/permuted layouts"
heuristics for continued necessity**, now that the exporter emits correct layouts directly for more cases.
One such heuristic (in `op_add`) was already found to be actively harmful once the exporter started
emitting correct `MUL_MAT` layouts itself, and was removed — the other two (in `op_mul` and `op_repeat`)
are untouched and unverified. These heuristics are shared by every model using these primitives (Whisper,
Conformer-CTC, VITS, Matcha-TTS, SupertonicTTS, Kokoro), not just LFM2's MIL export path, so removing one
needs per-model verification, not just LFM2's.

## Known gap: `matmul` composition only handles `transpose_x=False`

`tools/loom_mil_compiler/exporter.py`'s dedicated `op_type == "matmul"` composition only derives correct
`ggml_mul_mat` semantics for `transpose_x=False` (either `transpose_y` value — both occur in LFM2's SDPA
decomposition). Any other combination (`transpose_x=True`, alone or with `transpose_y=True`) raises
`NotImplementedError` by design rather than silently miscomputing. Not yet hit by any converted model; a
real derivation + test case is needed the first time one does.
